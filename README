| .emacs.d -> GNU Emacs configuration |
+-------------------------------------+

	A lightweight, fast, simple and crude configuration for GNU Emacs (Use for OCaml & Racket develop).

	----------

	SUITABLE FOR:
		 ./configure --without-x
		    	     --without-xwidgets
		    	     --without-x-toolkit
		    	     --without-native-compilation

	----------

	1. WHY SINGLE FILE:
	    This configuration file is very simple and easy to distribute and carry. Of course, there is nothing wrong with you thinking that it is original.

	2. WHY NOT GUI?
	    The GUI is of course very good, but for me the terminal is more immersive and more convenient. Generally speaking, it is a matter of personal habits.
