O FEATURES
  - OCaml, Racket development environment
  - Email configuration

O DEPENDS
  Before using this configuration, your operating system needs to have following libraries:
    - libjasson : https://github.com/akheron/jansson
    - libgnutls : https://gnutls.org/
    - mpg123    : http://mpg123.de/
    - libgccjit

  They can basically be installed from the package manager of the linux distribution.
  
  I use openSUSE Tumbleweed: zypper install libjasson-devel libgnutls-devel libgccjit-devel mpg123

O BUILD
  ./configure --without-x
              --without-xwidgets
              --with-x-toolkit=no
              --with-native-compilation
              --with-json
	      --with-mailutils
	      --with-pop
	      --with-native-compilation
	      --with-gnutls

O WHY THE MASTER BRANCH?
  I am not a radical person, but since this configuration is very simple,
  there are almost no bugs in the configuration itself,
  and it runs under the terminal, so there will be no problem with the emacs master version.

O WHY SINGLE FILE?
    This configuration file is very simple and easy to distribute and carry.
    Of course, there is nothing wrong with you thinking that it is original.

O WHY NOT GUI?
    The GUI is of course very good, but for me the terminal is more immersive and more convenient.
    Generally speaking, it is a matter of personal habits.
