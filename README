O WHY THE MASTER BRANCH?
  I am not a radical person, but since this configuration is very, very simple, there are almost no bugs in the configuration itself, and it runs under the terminal, so there will be no problem with the emacs master version

O BUILD CONFIGURATION
  ./configure --without-x
              --without-xwidgets
              --with-x-toolkit=no
              --with-native-compilation
              --with-json


O WHY SINGLE FILE?
    This configuration file is very simple and easy to distribute and carry. Of course, there is nothing wrong with you thinking that it is original.

O WHY NOT GUI?
    The GUI is of course very good, but for me the terminal is more immersive and more convenient. Generally speaking, it is a matter of personal habits.
