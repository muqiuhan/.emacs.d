o- NOTE: OCaml environment

The OCaml environment depends on `opam-user-setup.el`, which is generated to `.emacs.d` through `opam user-setup install`. 
If the `(setq-default ocaml-environment t)`, you need to execute this command first, and then remove the `(load "opam-user-setup.el")` at the end of `init.el`.
